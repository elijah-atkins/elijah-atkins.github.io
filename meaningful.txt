Ever get frustrated that a problem in your town or 
neighborhood goes ages without being resolved?
You might have road issues (potholes, dangerous areas..), 
overgrown plant issues, or anything else that makes living 
where you live a little less pleasant.
With Co-make you can make your voice heard on the issues 
you would like to see resolved in your community.
3 simple steps: Describe the problem. Other locals upvote 
the problem. 
Problems with the most upvote get prioritized 
by local government or HOAâ€™s to be resolved first.

As well as seeing real change in your community you get 
rewards for being a positive community member in the form 
of points, freebies and local recognition.

The problem we are solving: the disintegration in the 
relationship between local government and the people they 
represent. The feeling of apathy many have towards local 
issues. The inability of local government to reach and 
listen to their constituents effectively.
